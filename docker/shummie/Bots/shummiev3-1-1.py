# TODO LIST:
# -- Dijkstra's Algorithm for pathfinding?
# -- Look at more than 1 cell deep to see if we can capture territory earlier?
# -- How to identify which direction to focus growth? Looking at production map at beginning to see.
# -- Attack patterns? What's the best strategy for attacking / retreating / reinforcing?
# -- Varying production multiplier by distance to border?

# Version 1: Basic bot implementation - Modifications from random bot: To be added
# Version 2: 
# -- Moved hlt file to single file. 
# -- consolidate_strength: Completely rewritten. Searches all border tiles and then sees if we can consolidate. Ranked by production strength, then sees if we can consolidate.
# -- find_nearest_enemy_direction: Calculate ALL distances, and pick the shortest with lowest production if there is a tie. Otherwise, pick randomly.
# -- heuristic: look at not just the cell but adjacent cells to determine the value of capturing the cell.
# -- smallest strength cells move first.
